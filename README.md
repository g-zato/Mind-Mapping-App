# Flutter Mind Maps

This project is a personal experiment, so everything can be possibly changed. Clone it on your machine and give it a whirl! 

## Getting Started

To start playing around, clone the repo on your machine, install necessary dependencies and run it on whatever platform you like.

This project uses Graphview package (especifically the Buchheim Walker algorithm) to calculate Node positions efficiently. The premise is simple, but the possibilities are endless.

### Happy coding :)
